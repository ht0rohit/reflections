When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?

  I would rather create a remote repository than keeping all my work local 
when I want others also to contribute to my project and suggest changes.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  I actually don't know :-)

Describe the differences b/w forks, clones & branches. When
would you use one instead of another?

  -forks are the cloned repository directly into ones Github's account
  -clones are copied or downloaded version of an entire repository from
GitHub to our local computer
  -branches are other versions of the same file that some other
contributors might be working upon
